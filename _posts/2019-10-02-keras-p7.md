In this part of the series, we will introduce Recurrent Neural Networks aka RNNs that made a major breakthrough in predictive analytics for sequential data. This article covers RNNs on both conceptual and practical levels. We will start with the definition of RNNs, why and when they are used, then we will build an RNN ourselves for sentiment analysis.
