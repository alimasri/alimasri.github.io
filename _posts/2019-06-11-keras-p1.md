This post is the first part of Deep Learning with Keras series. This series aims to introduce the Keras deep learning library and how to use it to train various deep learning models. We will cover topics such as regression, classification, convolution, recurrent networks, transfer learning and many others. The tutorials will be completely example driven to make sure the readers learn the concepts and how to apply them on real datasets.
