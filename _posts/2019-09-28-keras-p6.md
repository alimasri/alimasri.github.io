subtitle: Textual Data Preprocessing
---
Congratulations for going far in this Keras tutorial. After working with numeric, categorical and image data, it is time to handle textual data. Deep learning has proved itself in being very effective with Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Before we dive into how to build NLP models, let us learn how to handle and preprocess textual data with Keras.

We already know that any machine learning model needs data to represented in a numeric format. Therefore, in this article we will learn how to load, preprocess, tokenize, convert and pad textual data into numeric sequences.
