In the previous articles, we solved problems with numeric and categorical data, and we learned the different transformations needed for each. Regarding images, we investigated a simple hack that resizes each image into an array of pixels and feed it to the input layer. The approach worked well and we reached around 97% accuracy on MNIST dataset.
