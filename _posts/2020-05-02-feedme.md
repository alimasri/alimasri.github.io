I am happy to announce the release of my new program FeedMe. FeedMe provides an easy way to parse XML Feeds, render them in an HTML file, and send them based on a template to your email contacts. It supports tracking to send only fresh data in each run.
Using this application you can manage and run email campaigns easily without the need to any external tools.
